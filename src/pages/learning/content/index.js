        Accessibility (a11y) is so important as a content creator. There are so
        many things to consider when putting together content for web
        consumption. Did you get proper and meaningful alt text on all your
        images? Did you use proper markup for your table? Are you headings in
        the proper order? Have you even thought about these questions?

        This site has been designed to not only be a great reference point, but
        also an <strong>interactive learning experience</strong>. As you go on
        your journey learning a11y you will be able to experiment and get
        feedback on how you are doing! You'll learn, practice, and be assessed
        on your progress.
